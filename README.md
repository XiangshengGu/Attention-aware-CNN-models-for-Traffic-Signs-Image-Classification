## Abstract: 
Autonomous vehicle driving systems have become one of the most important topics recently, some people assert that they can identify traffic signs automatically, which is a revolutionary improvement for transportation; however, the accuracy of autonomous vehicle driving systems still remains controversial. Therefore, this research analyzes the German Traffic Sign Benchmark dataset, in three different ways: AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50 of autonomous vehicle driving systems, to compare the best approach for identifying traffic signs. One can conclude that AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet-50 performed well, as they got an accuracy score of 95%, 95%, 89% respectively. To improve the classification accuracy to achieve nearly 100% for total security, Bottleneck Attention Module (BAM) is examined as a way of improving the classification accuracy of models and it is confirmed that BAM is able to boost the accuracy score of select models.
